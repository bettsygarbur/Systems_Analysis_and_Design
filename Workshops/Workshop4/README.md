# Child Mind Institute — Problematic Internet Use (Simulations)

This repository contains a simulation study based on the Kaggle competition *“Child Mind Institute — Problematic Internet Use”*, focused on predicting the Severity Impairment Index (sii, 0–3) and exploring emergent patterns of problematic internet use in youth.[web:2]

## Repository structure

- `train.csv`, `test.csv` – Tabular data used for model training and inference.  
- `doct.py` – Main script for Scenario 1 (data‑driven ML pipeline, CatBoost).  
- `predicciones.csv` – Model predictions for the test set generated by `doct.py`.  
- `scenario2_history.csv` – Time evolution of sii counts produced by the cellular automaton (Scenario 2).  
- `report/` – LaTeX sources and the final PDF report describing, designing, and analysing the simulations.  
- `README.md` – Project overview and usage instructions.[web:196]

## Simulation approaches

### Scenario 1 – Data‑driven ML pipeline

Scenario 1 implements a supervised learning pipeline where sii is derived from the PCIAT total score and used as a four‑class ordinal target. The script `doct.py` loads `train.csv` and `test.csv`, aligns columns, detects categorical features, encodes missing categorical values as `"missing"`, and computes balanced class weights to mitigate label imbalance before fitting a `CatBoostClassifier`.[web:58][web:119] The trained model predicts sii for all rows in `test.csv`, and the outputs are written to `predicciones.csv` for further evaluation and comparison.

### Scenario 2 – Event‑based cellular automaton

Scenario 2 models the system as a population of individuals placed on a two‑dimensional grid, where each cell stores an sii state (0–3) and a discretised internet‑usage level. Initial states are sampled from the cleaned training data, and local update rules combine self‑risk (current sii and internet level), neighbour influence (fraction of neighbours with high sii), and stochastic noise, updating all cells synchronously at each time step.[web:30][web:111] The function `run_simulation` iterates these rules for a fixed number of steps, recording at each step how many cells fall into each sii level and exporting the full trajectory to `scenario2_history.csv`.

## How to run the simulations

1. **Scenario 1 (ML pipeline)**  
   - Ensure `train.csv` and `test.csv` are in the repository root.  
   - Run:
     ```
     python doct.py
     ```  
   - Inspect `predicciones.csv` for the predicted sii labels.

2. **Scenario 2 (cellular automaton)**  
   - Ensure `train.csv` is available in the working directory used by the Scenario 2 script.  
   - Run the CA script (e.g. `python scenary2.py` or the corresponding filename).  
   - Inspect `scenario2_history.csv` and console output for the temporal evolution and final distribution of sii.

## Report

The folder `report/` contains the LaTeX sources and the final PDF in which the simulations are formally described, the two scenarios are designed and justified, and the main results are analysed and discussed.
