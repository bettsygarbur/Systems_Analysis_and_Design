# Systems Analysis & Design – Systems Engineering

## 📚 Course Overview
This repository contains the materials, assignments, and collaborative work developed in the course **Systems Analysis & Design** at *Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas*. The course provides both theoretical and practical foundations for the application of **systems engineering principles**, with a focus on modeling, analysis, and design of complex systems.

Throughout the semester, students approach case studies, workshops, and projects that integrate **General Systems Theory**, **system dynamics**, and **systems thinking** to address real-world problems. The repository serves as a central hub for documentation, reports, diagrams, and supporting code.

## 🎯 Course Objectives
- Develop the ability to analyze systems as dynamic, adaptive, and interconnected entities.
- Apply concepts such as **supersystems and subsystems**, **feedback loops**, **emergent behavior**, **entropy**, **homeostasis**, and **chaos theory** in practical contexts.
- Strengthen modeling and problem-structuring skills for complex scenarios.
- Encourage collaborative, research-oriented work through workshops and project-based learning.
